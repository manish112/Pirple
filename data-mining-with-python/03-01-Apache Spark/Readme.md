Homework Assignment #3: Apache Spark

Details:
 

1. Import pyspark into your notebook and create a new appName as â€œHomework 3"

2. Following the examples in the previous lectures, create a simulation of the following conditions:

Rather than a single 2-sided coin, there are two 6-sided dice.
When the dice are rolled, their outcomes should be added together.
The dice should be rolled 100 times
3. Once the simulation is complete, collect the resulting outcomes and present them in a table within your notebook.

4. Display the table data as a histogram. The x-axis should be the possible outcomes (2,3,4 etc), and the y-axis should represent the total number of times that outcome appeared in the simulation.
