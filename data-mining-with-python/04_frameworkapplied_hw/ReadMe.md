Homework Assignment #4: Map and Flatmap

Details:
 

1. Go back to Kaggle and find a dataset representing the match history of your favorite team sport. The exact sport doesn't matter, as long as there are multiple players on a team, and the dataset includes the individual performance/scores for each player in each matchup during a given season.

2. Pick a single team to analyze.

3. Following the examples in the previous lectures, determine the following metrics for each player on the team you chose, as it relates to points/score per matchup:
min
max
median
lower quartile
upper quartile

4. Display the data as a boxplot. The x-axis should be the player names, and the y-axis should visualize a boxplot of the numerical data from step 2.

5. Follow the "Turning it In" instructions below carefully.
