Homework Assignment #3: "If" Statements


Details:
 
Create a function that accepts 3 parameters and checks for equality between any two of them.

Your function should return True if 2 or more of the parameters are equal, and false is none of them are equal to any of the others.


Extra Credit:

Modify your function so that strings can be compared to integers if they are equivalent. For example, if the following values are passed to your function:

6,5,"5"

You should modify it so that it returns true instead of false.

Hint: there's a built in Python function called "int" that will help you convert strings to Integers.
