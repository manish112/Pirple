Homework Assignment #6: Advanced Loops


Details:
 
Create a function that takes in two parameters: rows, and columns, both of which are integers. The function should then proceed to draw a playing board (as in the examples from the lectures) the same number of rows and columns as specified. After drawing the board, your function should return True.


Extra Credit:

Try to determine the maximum width and height that your terminal and screen can comfortably fit without wrapping. If someone passes a value greater than either maximum, your function should return False.
